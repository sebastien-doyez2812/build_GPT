# ðŸ’» Recreate nanoGPT using Pytorch ðŸ’»

This repo is about the architecture nanoGPT, which is inspired by the article ["Attention is all you need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

For this project, I used Pytorch, and I used the lecture of Andrej Karpathy about this article.

If you have GPUs, use the python script 
`
train.py
`

else, you can use Google collab to import and run the notebook 
`
Train_nanogpt_on_notebook.ipynb
`
